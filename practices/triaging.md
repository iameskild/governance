# Triaging guidelines

Triaging is a fundamental task of open source maintenance. The goal of triaging is to provide community members and contributors with a clear understanding of what will happen to their issue.

For example, after a feature request was triaged you know whether we plan to tackle the issue or whether we'll wait to hear what the broader community thinks about this request.
